To Be Done.

== Page Generation Flow

In server mode (only implemented currently), page generation goes as follows:

. Read page
. Convert page
** For HTML, do cleanup
. Determine template
. Run template
. Output page

== Templates

TBD

=== Passthrough Template

The *PassThrough* template simple passes the content through as is.
This is generally used for pure HTML pages, such as a custom index page.

Not implemented yet.

=== Making a Menu

The *TopLeftMenu* template creates pages where there is a top-level menu on the top bar and secondary menu levels on the left.

Not implemented yet.
